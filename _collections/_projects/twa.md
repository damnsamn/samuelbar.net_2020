The <a class="link link-blue link-external" href="https://www.wavisitorcentre.com.au/" title="Visit Western Australian Visitor Centre Website">Western Australian Visitor Centre</a> were looking to create an engaging and collaborative experience for tourists visiting the centre to find local attractions and destinations. Currently, the staff were having to recommend and direct visitors to specific attractions in one-to-one interactions. They would also write out physical itineraries for visitors by request - a labour and time intensive process.

They came to us having ordered an enormous wall-scale touchscreen - two-and-a-half metres wide - with a single requirement: a single page that links to existing Tourism WA assets. A simple goal, but working with such an unfamiliar scale, I got excited. I wanted to create something a little more useful and interactive.

I immediately got to work on a to-scale model out of A4 sheets of paper. Due to the scale of the project I was also able to wireframe at a 1:1 scale on a whiteboard, comparing touch target sizes to be comfortably pressed by whole either hands or finger presses.

I decided that rather than being simply a list of links, we could utilise the screen as an interactive medium for building an itinerary using both curated and dynamically-generated lists of WA attractions. This works as an organisation-driven alternative to relying solely on the staff's memory and knowledge, where the staff can now help to guide and collaborate with visitors to help them build and print their own holiday itineraties.
