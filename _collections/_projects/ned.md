<a href="https://www.indigosolutions.org.au/">Indigo Solutions</a> were looking to replace and upgrade their National Equipment Database (NED) - a database of Assitive Technology products and their suppliers across Australia. They wanted to transition to more of an e-commerce model, connecting suppliers and consumers directly through their platform.

Although the UX design was done externally, I had oversight over that process and was granted license to make tweaks and changes as necessary during the course of development.

We built the new NED site on CS-Cart, which provided a lot of the e-commerce capabilities Indigo required out of the box. My role was to create a from-scratch custom theme for NED (akin to custom WordPress themes).
