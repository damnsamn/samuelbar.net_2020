To coincide with the launch of their new brand identity, [City of Mandurah](https://www.mandurah.wa.gov.au/) were also looking to launch a brand-new website. With a key objective being to help users to find their desired civic services quicker and easier than ever, while also showcasing all that Mandurah has to offer.

While another agency carried out the UX Designs, I was tasked with providing input on the designs from a front-end development perspective to ensure that the scope of designed components and screens could be reasonably developed within the projects budget and timeline.
