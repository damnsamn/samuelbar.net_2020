InSig Technologies were building a prototype of the system when I was brought on board. Some of the functionality was complete, but the visual design left something to be desired. This product was to be the basis of InSig's future product development - so alongside the User Experience, I was also tasked with creating a robust and consistent design system for new products to come.

Starting with the dashboard, we experimented with several iterations of the look and feel until we landed on something the team was happy to carry through the rest of the project. By the end of the project, we had a consistent style guide and design system for them to carry forward into their future product lines.

With "futuristic UI" as a prompt from the primary stakeholder, the designs started with a retro-futuristic style based on film interpretations of sci-fi interfaces. Not sold, we then overcorrected to a more "safe" white & blue iteration, to fit right in with the common software end-users would be more familiar with. Again, not sold, we went through several other iterations of a "dark theme" before landing on a style that felt a little more modern and near-future, with glassy, tactile-looking UI elements.

<div class="row">

{% include common/image.html class="col-12 col-lg-6" alt="Iteration of the interface with a more standard, microsoft-like look and feel" src="/assets/images/projects/InSig/Dashboard-second.png" caption="Our second try - a safer and more familiar style" %}
</div>

By the end of the project, I had produced a figma-based design system to allow InSig to piece together new products using pre-designed components and controls. With their new product line using this component library, they could always be confident in maintaining a consistent look and feel for future products.
