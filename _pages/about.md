# Like I was saying...

I've spent the last couple of years working as the UX Designer/Developer at Diversus - a software consultancy based in West Perth. Typically I'm brought in to provide end-to-end UX design and front-end development expertise for a project, ensuring that the UX and front-end match up and the needs of each can be met at each stage of the process.

I've been given amazing opportunities to work with big-name clients, such as Optus Stadium and Tourism WA, as well as several state government agencies, and some exciting startups. I take immense pride in having made a positive impact and impression with these clients.

When I'm not working, I'll be indoor bouldering (rock climbing), playing video games, wishing my cats would love me like I love them, creative coding, or otherwise procrastinating work on personal/passion projects. I have an unreasonable love for writing RegEx find/replace patterns.
