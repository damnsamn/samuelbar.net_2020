# Like I was saying...

I'm currently working as a Front-end Developer at [Humaan](https://humaan.com/) - a creative digital agency based in Perth. With a UX/UI skillset in addition to the front-end development, I'm assisting both with the front-end implementations for projects as well as assisting the UX team ensuring that the UX and front-end match up and the needs of each can be met at each stage of the process.

I've been given amazing opportunities to work with big-name clients, such as Optus Stadium and Tourism WA, as well as several state government agencies, and some exciting startups. I take immense pride in having made a positive impact and impression with these clients.

When I'm not working, I'll be indoor bouldering (rock climbing), playing video games, wishing my cats would love me like I love them, creative coding, or otherwise procrastinating work on personal/passion projects. I have an unreasonable love for writing RegEx find/replace patterns.
