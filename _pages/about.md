# Go on...

I've spent the last couple of years working as the UX Designer/Developer at Diversus - a software consultancy based in West Perth. Typically I'm brought in to provide end-to-end UX and front-end development work, but I'm also often tasked with prettying-up developers' work.

I've been given amazing opportunities to work with big-name clients, such as Optus Stadium and Tourism WA, as well as several state government agencies. I take immense pride in having made a positive impact and impression with these clients.

When I'm not working, I love indoor bouldering (rock climbing), playing video games, and pretending I don't have personal projects I should be working on instead.
