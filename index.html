        <p>I design and develop websites and other digital experiences. I’m currently based in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
        <p>I love to build digital products from the ground up: starting from ideas and conversations; through carefully considered designs; to satisfying, user-friendly and accessible solutions. I also really enjoy dipping my toes into whichever technology or skillset is necessary to reach an awesome solution.</p>
